Netcat
       nc - TCP/IP swiss army knife

SYNOPSIS
       nc [-options] hostname port[s] [ports] ...
       nc -l -p port [-options] [hostname] [port]

DESCRIPTION
       netcat  is  a  simple unix utility which reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol. It is designed to be a reliable "back-end" tool that can be
       used directly or easily driven by other programs and scripts.  At the same time, it is a feature-rich network debugging and exploration tool, since it can create almost any kind
       of  connection  you  would need and has several interesting built-in capabilities.  Netcat, or "nc" as the actual program is named, should have been supplied long ago as another
       one of those cryptic but standard Unix tools.


touch is a pretty simple command, it creates files. Given the command touch b.txt, b.txt would be created.
